## Challeneges

### Conocco

Find an innovative way to display oil and gas production statistics/data sets. These are large and complex data sets.

### LyondellBasell

Don't run out of Resources!

LYB's team has encountered a few issues when developing Field Applications for Autonomous and Personal Devices off-world!  
Do you have what it take to accompany them in hteir oddyssey and help these Devices find their way back home?

* Coordinates: 23.42, 34.56
* Power: 26%
* Available Storage: 56%
* Wi-Fi Availability: None

HD Video will be recorded, since internet connectivity will be sparse, we need to make sure our devices are able to go back to a zone to replenish our resources. Give multiple solutions to the problems.

In Discord or booth to ask questions and get more information.

### Pros

Create an application personalizes and/or optimizes the ecommerce shopping experience of a consumer.

Examples:

A mobile application that allows a consumer to provide a picture of an item and ir performs a search to find similar items at retail locations and highlights the best price.

### Side Quests

* Best UI
* Best Beginner hack
* Best Use of Cloud
* Most Sustainable

### Issue 1
Implement a mechanism to prevent Devices from running out of space while recording Field Events during Field Activities – such as detecting the rate in which the space is consumed by a Field Application and directing Autonomous or Personal Devices to the nearest Internet Availability Zone before the Device runs out of space.

### Issue 2
Implement a mechanism to prevent Devices from running out of battery while recording Field Events during Field Activities – such as detecting the rate in which battery is being depleted at during the usage of a Field Application and directing Autonomous or Personal Devices to the nearest Charging Station before the Device runs out of battery.

### Issue 3
Implement a mechanism that would allow Devices to use an offline copy of a map so Devices can be directed to the nearest Replenish Zone to replenish Space or Power. This mechanism should also record updates to the map so they can be later applied to the centralized map version.
