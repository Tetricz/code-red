    <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p> To simulate a Mars Rover and the personal aviable on Mars. The rover goes around collecting data, handing task, and manageming its own data/battery. 
            The rover is supposed to go to designated power and wifi spots. Unless otherwise stated, the two resource returnal spots are seperated and can 
            not increase battery's energy and upload storage. Access points are also increasing as the rover discoveres new resource renewal spots.
